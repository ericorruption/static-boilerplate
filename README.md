# Static Boilerplate [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/ericorruption/static-boilerplate.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is how I roll.

## Dependencies
[Node.js v8.7.0+](https://nodejs.org) (Preferably through the use of [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))

## Installing
Run `npm install` after cloning the project and navigating to the project folder in your terminal.

## Running
In the project folder type `npm start` to spin a local server with live reloading and asset processing.

## Deployment
When you're ready to deploy, you can generate a production-ready build by issuing
the `npm run build` command. You will have the generated assets inside the `dist` folder.

## Contributing
Fork it. Branch it. Push it. PR it.

## TODO
* image optimization
* enforce html style
* static asset hashing
* inline critical css
* continuous integration with Travis CI
