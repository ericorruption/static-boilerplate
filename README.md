# Static Boilerplate
This is how I roll. To get started:

* Install node
* Install grunt-cli
* Install bower
* `npm install`
* `bower install`
* Copy the latest versions of respond and html5shiv to `js/libs`
* Update jQuery reference if necessary
* `grunt`
* Have fun!


## TODO
* grunt deploy task
* improve docs, obviously.
